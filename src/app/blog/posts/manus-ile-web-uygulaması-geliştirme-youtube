# 🚀 Game Idea: "Reflex Hunter" — Reaction Time Challenge

## 🎯 Concept

- A target (e.g., a red circle) appears at **random times and positions** on the screen.
- The player must **click it as fast as possible** once it appears.
- Each successful click grants points **based on reaction time** (e.g., 100ms = 100 points).
- Total game duration: **30 seconds**.
- At the end of the round, display results like:
  - `"Your average reaction time: 214ms | Score: 8420"`

## 🧠 Why It’s Attention-Grabbing

- Fully **playable on both mobile and desktop devices**.
- Short but **addictive gameplay loop**.
- Can be enhanced with **sound effects**, **visual animations**, **score tracking**, and a **leaderboard**.
- **Competitive experience** encourages replayability.
